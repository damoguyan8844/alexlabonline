BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

SQLite Database Browser requires Trolltech's QT. It has been tested 
with versions 3.12 and 3.2 of QT. QT can be included as
a static or shared library, depending on the current QT configuration
in the building machine. For more information on QT please consult
http://www.trolltech.com. The GPL version of QT is available in almost 
all Linux distributions as a default package.

SQLite is not used as a shared library: it is built from source code
included in this package (sqlite_source directory), and linked as a 
static library into the executable. 

SQLite is ideal for embedding, so the only requirement
for building this code is the presence of QT. QT can be included as
a static or shared library, depending on the current QT configuration
in the building machine.

Provided you have QT installed and configured, simply run

qmake 

followed by

make

in the main directory. This will generate the

browser (or browser.exe, or browser.app)

application in the browser subdirectory.

The same process works for building the code
in any platform supported by QT (including other Unix systems with
X11.) 

You may want to rename the final executable or .app bundle from
"browser" to "SQLite Database Browser", to match the official binaries 
released at http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net. 

Please check the LICENSING file for additional information.
