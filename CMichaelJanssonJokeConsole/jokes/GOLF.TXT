"Funny Old Golfing rules"
"Each player shall furnish his own equipment, normally one club and two balls."
"Play on the course must be approved by the owner of the course."
"Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole."
"For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check the stiffness of the shaft before play begins."
"The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again."
"It is considered bad form, to begin playing the hole immediately upon arriving at the course. The experienced player will admire the entire course, with special attention paid to the well formed bunkers."
"Players are cautioned not to mention any other courses they have played, or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have been known to damage the players equipment for this reason."
"Players should ensure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, especially on a new course being played forthe first time. Previous players have been known to get irate if they find someone playing what they consider to be their own private course."
"Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to use tact in this determination. More advanced players playing more advanced courses will find alternate means of play if this is the case."
"It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting to play the same hole several times in one match."
"Course owners shall be the sole judge of who is the best player."
