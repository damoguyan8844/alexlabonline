"Rules Made by the WOMAN"
"   1.  The female always makes the rules."
"   2.  The rules are subject to change at any time without prior notification."
"   3.  No male can possibly know all the rules."
"   4.  If the female suspects the male knows all the rules, she  must immediately change some or all of the rules."
"   5.  The female is never wrong."
"   6.  If the female is WRONG it is because of a flagrant mis- understanding which as a direct result of something the male did or said, wrong."
"   7.  If rule 6 applies, the male must apologize immediately for causing the misunderstanding."
"   8.  The female can change her mind at any given point in time  or place, or whenever deemed appropriate."
"   9.  The male must never change his mind without express written  consent from the female."
"  10.  The female has every right to be angry or upset at any  time, or about anything she wishes."
"  11.  The male must remain calm at all times, unless the female  wants him to be angry or upset."
"  12.  The female must under no circumstances let the male know  whether or not she wants him to be angry or upset."
"  13.  Any attempt to document these rules could result in bodily  harm."
"  14.  If the female has PMS, all rules are null and void."
