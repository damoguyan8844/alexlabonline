LICENSING

This code is in Public Domain. You may do whatever you want with it.

However, the same is not true for the Qt libraries needed to build
this software, and this places restrictions on how you can develop
and license derivative works.

The original code was developed and built with licensed, commercial
versions of Qt on Windows, MacOSX and Linux. Developers that wish to
produce derivative work and use it in commercial projects need to hold
a commercial Qt license as well. 

If you are however working on a project licensed with the GPL/LGPL you may 
use the GPL/LGPL version of Qt. You may release derivative works of this 
software with any license you want as long as we are concerned, including
GPL, LGPL, Public Domain or Commercial, provided you abide to the licensing
terms of the version of Qt you have installed on your machine. 

Please consult www.trolltech.com/licensing if you have any questions 
about QT licensing.
